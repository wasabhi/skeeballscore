# Skee Ball Score App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The intent of this project is to teach my son about React by coding an app that
accompanies a handmade cardboard Skee Ball game that he and his brother are
making for their school Maker Faire.
